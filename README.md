Comments and changes on the mockup 

- The 'Get Started' plus icon was changed to an arrow icon instead to signify that clicking the button directs the user somewhere rather than 'adding' something. 
- I altered the layout of the body with the text of the 'Tools' section on the left so that content is seen first rather than the media itself.
- I changed the 'Play video' button to just a play icon to follow usability heuristics so users easily understand that it is a video.
- The 'Awards' section on the original mockup visually looked less orderly so I instead aligned them together in one row and introduced a carousel style to display the cards so that more cards could be added in the future to make it more scalable.
- In the original mockup, the FAQ doesn't instinctively look like an FAQ which may confuse users on its function. I changed to a more traditional UI of an FAQ for users to easily identify it's use.
